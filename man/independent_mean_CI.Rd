\title{Independent samples mean confidence interval (equal variance assumed)}
\usage{
independent_mean_CI(
  data,
  continuous,
  grouping,
  confidence = 0.95,
  variance = "equal",
  reference = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame or tibble.}

\item{continuous}{Unquoted column name for continuous outcome.}

\item{grouping}{Unquoted column name for grouping variable (factor or character).}

\item{confidence}{Confidence level for interval (default 0.95).}

\item{variance}{Character string; "equal" (default) or "unequal" variance assumption.}

\item{reference}{Optional character string naming the reference group. Must be quoted and
match one of the grouping values exactly. If provided, the output and CI will be reported
as μ[reference] - μ[other]. If NULL (default) the order is determined by:
- if grouping is a factor, the factor level order (only levels present after NA removal),
- otherwise, the order of first appearance in the data after NA removal.}
}
\value{
None. Prints the confidence interval and point estimate.
