  data,
  continuous,
  grouping,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  mu = 0,
  alpha = 0.05,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame or tibble.}

\item{continuous}{Unquoted column name for continuous outcome.}

\item{grouping}{Unquoted column name for grouping variable (factor or character).}

\item{alternative}{Character string specifying alternative hypothesis; "two.sided", "two",
"less", or "greater" (default "two.sided"). "two" is accepted as an alias for "two.sided".}

\item{mu}{Numeric hypothesized mean difference (default 0).}

\item{alpha}{Numeric significance level (default 0.05).}

\item{variance}{Character string; "equal" (default) or "unequal" variance assumption.}

\item{reference}{Optional character string naming the reference group. Must be quoted and
match one of the grouping values exactly. See independent_mean_CI for ordering rules.}

\value{
None. Prints formatted test results and conclusion.
